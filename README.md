# Personal Expense Tracker

## Description

In today’s fast-paced world, managing personal finances effectively is crucial. The Personal Expense Tracker is a tool that allows users to log daily expenses, categorize them, and track spending against a monthly budget. It also includes file-handling capabilities to save and load expense data for future reference, ensuring users can manage their expenses over time.

## Objectives

- Design and implement a personal expense tracker to manage daily expenses.
- Allow users to categorize expenses and set monthly budgets.
- Provide file-handling functionality to save and load expense data.
- Create an interactive, menu-driven interface for ease of use.

## Features

1. **Add an Expense**
   - Prompt the user for expense details:
     - Date (in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`).
     - Category (e.g., Food, Travel).
     - Amount spent.
     - A brief description of the expense.
   - Store the expense in a list as a dictionary, with keys for `date`, `category`, `amount`, and `description`.

   **Example:**
   ```python
   {
       'date': '2024-09-18',
       'category': 'Food',
       'amount': 15.50,
       'description': 'Lunch with friends'
   }
   ```

2. **View Expenses**
   - Retrieve and display all stored expenses.
   - Loop through the list of expenses and display the date, category, amount, and description for each entry.
   - Validate the data before displaying:
     - If any required fields are missing (date, category, amount, or description), skip the entry or notify the user.

3. **Set and Track the Budget**
   - Allow the user to set a monthly budget.
   - Calculate the total expenses recorded and compare with the monthly budget.
   - Display a warning if expenses exceed the budget, or show the remaining balance if within the budget.

4. **Save and Load Expenses**
   - Save all expenses to a CSV file, with each row containing the date, category, amount, and description.
   - Load expenses from the CSV file when the program starts to restore the previous state.

5. **Interactive Menu**
   - Display a menu with the following options:
     1. Add Expense
     2. View Expenses
     3. Set Monthly Budget
     4. Track Budget
     5. Save Expenses
     6. Exit
   - Allow the user to select an option by entering the corresponding number.
   - Implement functionality for each menu option:
     - Option 1: Call the function to add an expense.
     - Option 2: Call the function to view expenses.
     - Option 3: Call the function to set the monthly budget.
     - Option 4: Call the function to track the budget.
     - Option 5: Call the function to save expenses.
     - Option 6: Save the expenses and exit the program.
